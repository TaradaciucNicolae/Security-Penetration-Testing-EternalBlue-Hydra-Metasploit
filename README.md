Practical Security Penetration Testing: Attack and Detection

This repository presents a hands-on security analysis demonstrating penetration testing techniques using Hydra, Metasploit, and Suricata. 
It covers:
    Brute-force attacks with Hydra
    Exploitation of EternalBlue using Metasploit
    Threat detection and monitoring with Suricata

This project bridges both offensive and defensive cybersecurity approaches, illustrating how attacks are executed and detected in a real-world scenario.
